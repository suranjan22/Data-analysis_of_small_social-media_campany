Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data.

What you need to do:

First: Open the three data sets below


1.Reaction Types
2.Reactions
3.Content

all are excel/google sheet format.

 

Second: Clean the data by:

removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

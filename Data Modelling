Data Modelling
Okay, we’re nearly there! You’re doing a great job. 

Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. To complete your data modelling, follow these steps:

1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:

A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories
